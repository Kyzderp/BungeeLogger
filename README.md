# BungeeLogger
Simple logging API for BungeeCord plugins

BungeeLogger is an API for BungeeCord plugins built on log4j, aimed at providing better logging than BungeeCord's built-in logger. This is not the same thing as the BungeeLogger class inside BungeeCord! Instead of spitting out one huge proxy.log.0 file, BungeeLogger mimics Minecraft/Bukkit/Spigot server logging by rolling over the log file at midnight and storing the logs in logs/ under the Bungee directory, with the format bungee.log.yyyy-mm-dd. The main difference, however, is that a new log file is not started upon every Bungee restart; there is only one log file per day.


## Usage
To create a logger for your plugin, add BungeeLogger as a dependency and use the createLogger() method in the BungeeLoggerPlugin instance, passing in your plugin class as the single argument. This will return a BungeeLog object that you can invoke in a similar manner to other loggers.

Example Bungee plugin class:

    import io.github.kyzderp.bungeelogger.BungeeLog;
    import io.github.kyzderp.bungeelogger.BungeeLoggerPlugin;
    import net.md_5.bungee.api.plugin.Plugin;
    
    public class ExampleBungeePlugin extends Plugin
    {
      private BungeeLog exampleLogger;
      
      public void onLoad()
      {
        this.exampleLogger = BungeeLoggerPlugin.instance.createLogger(this);
        this.exampleLogger.info("Plugin loaded!");
      }
      
      public void onEnable()
      {
        this.exampleLogger.info("Plugin enabled!");
      }
      
      public void onDisable()
      {
        this.exampleLogger.info("Plugin disabled!");
      }
    }
